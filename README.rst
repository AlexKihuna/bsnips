Description
===========
This is a collection of snippets of code that I find interesting and/or redefined quite repetitively across projects.
Also includes some algorithms/snippets that are occasionally asked to be implemented in interviews/class. The goal of
this project is to have some easily accessible source for all these algorithms.

Contents
